Bionic-based **renderdoccmd** can be used as the [remoteserver](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_network_capture_replay.html#configuring-remote-hosts) and in **qrenderdoc** type "127.0.0.1" in **hostname** to connect.  
  
There are bugs in remote replay  context. Try to save the capture and replay by the local context.
